# pHControl
Upgrading codebase for the pH Control experiment

Current software is running in LabView, in the form of four sub-VIs:
+ Arduino_PumpCheck_v1
+ Vernier pH meter v1_0
+ pH Datalogger v2
+ pH Controller v2
Please see the folder labeled "Old Code" for these subVIs

The goal for this project is to replicate the functionality of the LabView software, first in MatLab and then in Python.

The development of the codebase in Matlab should be cleanly documented into an SOP, so that we can provide this to students.
